      <p>Please take a look at some of my projects from my first week in <em>Epicodus.</em></p>
        <ol>
          <li>You can find my very first webpage using HTML <a href="https://github.com/dzhambov/my-first-website"><strong>here.</strong></a></li>
          <li>One of my favorite things to do is cook pasta a la Bolognese. I used Markdow to present this delicious <a href="https://github.com/dzhambov/food-blog/blob/master/food-blog.md"><strong>recipe.</strong></a>
          </li>
          <li>I also enjoy traveling, so I created a <a href="https://github.com/dzhambov/resort-website"><strong>private island resort</strong></a> webpage and used CSS to bring more colors and add different fonts to it.</li>
          <li>On Thursday I tried to replicate Wikipedia webpage by using <a href="https://github.com/dzhambov/fake-wikipedia"><strong>Bootstrap.</strong></a></li>

    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>I am originally from Bulgaria, but ventured to United States almost 20 years ago. I've lived in <span class="city">NYC</span> and <span class="city">Boston</span> (most of the time) and now here in <span class="city">Portland</span>. Most of my career I spent working in high-end restaurants, but I also worked in real estate and banking briefly. I am about three semesters away from finishing a degree in Finance. I picked up an interest in coding about six months ago and decided to persue a career in coding, because I think that this is a vital skill to have in more and more industries. After researching different bootcamp options and talking to people it became very clear that <em>Epicodus</em> is the right place for me. </p>
